# Humans-or-Bots

This is my take on classifying between humans and bots on a bidding website. All the data was obfuscated so all the features had to be engineered. You can find that information in Feature_Engineering notebook. 

All the functions for modeling and feature engineering are made in func_project3.py file.

The results for all the models are in Modeling notebook.
